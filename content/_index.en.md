## 致不晚

*在音乐里我们牵手复活了的青春*  
*音乐里我们凝望流转和逝去*  
*音乐里我们飞翔在一首歌那么长的*  
*永恒*

# The Boovan

Welcome to The Boovan (不晚), a North American Chinese band based in North Texas. We're a group of Chinese American musicians who play for fun, love, and the people we care about.

## What We Do

We're not just about making music – we're about bringing joy to our community through:

- **Live Performances** - Band performances for events, parties, and celebrations
- **Demo Music** - Original songs and covers that speak to our hearts
- **Sound Services** - Professional DJ and sound equipment services
- **Music Production** - Helping others bring their musical visions to life

## Our Philosophy

**Never Too Late** - It's never too late to pursue your passions, to make music, to bring people together, and to celebrate life with the people you love.
