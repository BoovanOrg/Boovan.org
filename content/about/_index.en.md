## 致不晚

*在音乐里我们牵手复活了的青春*  
*音乐里我们凝望流转和逝去*  
*音乐里我们飞翔在一首歌那么长的*  
*永恒*

## Our Story

The Boovan (不晚) was born from a simple idea: it's never too late to make music that matters. We're a group of Chinese American musicians based in the North Texas area who came together to share our love of music with our community.

Our name "不晚" (Bù Wǎn) means "Never Too Late" – a reminder that it's never too late to pursue your dreams, make music, and share joy with others.
